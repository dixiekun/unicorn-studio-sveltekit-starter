# IMPORTANT:

# Always read [project-overview.md](mdc:project-overview.md) before any code.

# Before you start coding always use [svelte.txt](mdc:svelte.txt) to always get the latest svelte syntax.

# After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update [project-overview.md](mdc:project-overview.md)

# Document the entire database schema in [project-overview.md](mdc:project-overview.md)


# For new migrations, make sure to add them to the same file.
